				<p>This is an extension of Challenge 1. This time, you need to add the two photos of your choice using the "attach" button. The <em>attach</em> icon typically resembles a paperclip and can be used to attach various types of files, not just photos. This will open up your file broswer which you can navigate to select your photo. Your photos are typically stored in a dedicated folder named "photos" or "pictures".</p>
